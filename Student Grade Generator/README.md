Grade Calculator
This simple program calculates a student's grade based on their mark. It prompts the user to input a mark within the range of 0 to 100, calculates the corresponding grade using predefined grade boundaries, and then displays the result.

Functionality
calculateGrade(mark): This function takes a numerical mark as input and returns the corresponding grade based on predefined grade boundaries. Grades are assigned as follows:

A: Mark > 79
B: 60 <= Mark <= 79
C: 50 <= Mark < 60
D: 40 <= Mark < 50
E: Mark < 40
main(): This function is the entry point of the program. It continuously prompts the user to enter a mark until a valid input within the range of 0 to 100 is provided. Once a valid input is received, it calculates the grade using the calculateGrade() function and displays the result.

Usage
Open the program in a JavaScript environment (e.g., a web browser console or Node.js).
Run the program.
Enter the student's mark when prompted.
The program will display the corresponding grade for the entered mark.
Note
This program assumes that grade boundaries are predefined and do not change.
It provides a basic grade calculation functionality and can be expanded or modified as needed.
